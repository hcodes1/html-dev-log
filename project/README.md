# Hc's HTML Portfolio Project

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, built from scratch as part of my HTML learning journey.

## About This Project

This project served as a hands-on application of all HTML concepts covered in the course. It demonstrates my understanding of:

* **Basic HTML Structure:** `html`, `head`, `body`, `title`, meta tags.
* **Text Formatting:** Headings (`h1`-`h6`), paragraphs (`p`), lists (`ul`, `ol`, `li`).
* **Linking:** Hyperlinks (`a`) with relative file paths for navigation.
* **Images & Graphics:** Embedding images (`img`) with `src` and `alt` attributes, and basic inline SVG.
* **HTML Forms:** Creating forms (`form`) with various input types (`text`, `email`, `textarea`, `select`, `radio`, `checkbox`), labels (`label`), and client-side validation (`required`, `minlength`).
* **Layout Fundamentals:** Understanding block-level (`div`) and inline-level (`span`) elements for content grouping.
* **Semantic HTML5:** Structuring content with meaningful tags like `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`.
* **Tables:** Organizing tabular data (`table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tr`, `th`, `td`).
* **Special Elements:** Using `sup`, `sub`, and `code` for specific text formatting.

## Project Pages

* **Home/About Me:** (`index.html`) - Introduction, skills, and personal interests.
* **Projects:** (`projects.html`) - A list of my projects, presented in a table format.
* **Contact:** (`contact.html`) - A form for visitors to get in touch.

## How to View

To view this project, simply clone this repository and open any of the `.html` files in your web browser. For the best experience, use a Live Server extension in your code editor (like VS Code).

## What's Next?

This project forms the HTML foundation for my portfolio. The next steps in my web development journey will involve:

* **CSS:** Styling this website to make it visually appealing.
* **JavaScript:** Adding interactivity and dynamic features.
* Building out more complex projects!
