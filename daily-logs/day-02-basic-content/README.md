# Day 2: Basic Content Structure 

**Date:** July 11, 2025

## Topics Covered Today

* **Nesting and Indenting in HTML** : Learned best practices for writing clean and readable HTML code by properly nesting and indenting elements. This helps in understanding the hierarchy of elements.
* **HTML Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)** : Explored the use of heading tags to define different levels of importance for text, from the main title (`<h1>`) to minor subheadings (`<h6>`). This is crucial for content organization and SEO.
* **HTML Paragraphs (`<p>`)** : Understood how to use the paragraph tag to structure blocks of text, ensuring proper spacing and readability on the webpage.
* **HTML Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)** : Covered both unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists, and how to define individual list items using the `<li>` tag. This is useful for presenting information clearly.

## Key Concepts & Takeaways

* **HTML Elements are like containers:** They can contain text or other elements, forming a hierarchical structure.
* **Indentation is crucial for readability:** Helps visualize the nesting of elements.
* **Headings define importance:** Use `h1` for the main title, and then `h2`, `h3`, etc., for sub-sections in logical order. Don't skip levels.
* **Paragraphs for text blocks:** The `<p>` tag creates distinct text blocks with default spacing.
* **Lists for structured information:** `<ul>` for items without specific order, `<ol>` for numbered items, and `<li>` for individual items within lists.

## Daily Exercises & Code Examples

Here are the small, isolated practice files created today:

* **[Headings & Paragraphs Demo](./exercises/headings-paragraphs-demo.html)**: A simple HTML file demonstrating the use of `<h1>` through `<h6>` and `<p>` tags.
* **[Lists Demo](./exercises/lists-demo.html)**: An HTML file showcasing unordered and ordered lists with various list items.

## Portfolio Project Progress

Today, I continued building out my personal portfolio website, focusing on structuring its content.

* **`index.html`**:
    * Added `<h2>` headings for "About Me" and "My Skills & Interests" sections.
    * Wrote paragraphs for the "About Me" section.
    * Created an unordered list (`<ul>`) for my skills/interests.

## Daily Reflection

Today was a good step in understanding how to structure content within HTML. The importance of **nesting and indenting** really resonated, as I can already see how messy code could quickly become without it. Practicing with headings, paragraphs, and lists felt straightforward, and I'm starting to get a feel for how these basic building blocks come together.

**Challenges/Questions:**
* No challenges encountered, it was pretty smooth.

**Next Steps:**
* Review today's concepts before starting Day 3.
* Continue practicing daily Git commits.
