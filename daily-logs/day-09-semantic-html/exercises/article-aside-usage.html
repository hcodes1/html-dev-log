            <h2>The Importance of Semantic HTML</h2>
            <p><strong>Published: July 21, 2025</strong></p>
            <p>In the vast landscape of web development, merely getting content onto a page isn't enough. For a truly robust, accessible, and future-proof web presence, understanding and implementing semantic HTML is paramount. Semantic tags, unlike generic `div`s, convey meaning to both browsers and developers.</p>

            <p>When you use tags like `header`, `nav`, `main`, `article`, `section`, and `footer`, you're not just styling your page; you're building a meaningful structure. This structure helps search engines better understand your content, improving SEO. More importantly, it drastically enhances accessibility for users relying on screen readers and other assistive technologies.</p>

            <h3>Why `article` and `aside` Matter</h3>
            <p>The `article` tag is perfect for blog posts, news stories, comments, or any self-contained piece of content that could theoretically be syndicated independently. It tells the browser, "Hey, this chunk of content is a complete thought or item."</p>

            <p>The `aside` tag, on the other hand, is for content that is tangentially related to the main content, but distinct from it. Think of sidebars with related links, author bios, advertisements, or pull quotes. While it's related, it's not crucial to understanding the primary flow of the `article` it accompanies.</p>

            <p>By using these tags wisely, we contribute to a more organized, machine-readable, and user-friendly web.</p>
