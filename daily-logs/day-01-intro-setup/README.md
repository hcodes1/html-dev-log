# Day 1: Introduction & Setup 

**Date:** July 10, 2025

## Topics Covered

* **Introduction to HTML** : What HTML is, its role in web development, and the concepts of tags and elements.
* **The Web Development Toolkit** : Setting up VS Code and Live Server, and a brief overview of browser developer tools.
* **HTML Boilerplate**: Learning the essential basic structure of every HTML document.

## Key Concepts & Takeaways

* HTML is the **skeleton** of a webpage, defining its structure and content.
* Web development is an iterative process; focus on **building and improving**, not perfection.
* **VS Code** with **Live Server** is an efficient setup for development.
* Every HTML document starts with a basic `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` structure.
* Tags (`<p>`) define elements, and elements (`<p>Hello</p>`) contain content.

## Daily Exercises & Code Examples

Here are the small, isolated practice files created today:

* **[Basic HTML Boilerplate](./exercises/boilerplate-example.html)**: My very first HTML document.
* **[Exploring Tags and Elements](./exercises/basic-tags-example.html)**: Experimentation with simple tags like `<h1>` and `<p>`.

## Portfolio Project Progress

Today, I started the foundation of my personal portfolio website.

* Created the `project/` folder.
* Set up `project/index.html` with the basic HTML boilerplate.
* Added the main heading and an introductory paragraph.

## Daily Reflection

Today was exciting! Getting my development environment set up with VS Code and Live Server was straightforward. Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document and the concept of tags and elements feels like learning the alphabet of the web. I'm looking forward to adding more content to my portfolio and making it truly my own. The idea of building a project day-by-day is a great motivator!

**Challenges/Questions:**
* Ensuring the Live Server extension was working correctly took a moment, but troubleshooting with the course material helped.

**Next Steps:**
* Review HTML tags and elements.
* Prepare for Day 2's focus on basic content structure.
* Continue with daily Git commits for my progress.
