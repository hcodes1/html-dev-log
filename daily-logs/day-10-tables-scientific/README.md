# Day 10: Tables & Scientific Elements

**Date:** July 21, 2025

## Topics Covered Today

* **HTML Tables (`<table>`)** : Creating structured data tables.
* **Table Rows, Headers, Data (`<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`)** : Building the rows and cells of a table.
* **Table Sections (`<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`)** : Structuring tables into header, body, and footer groups.
* **Superscript and Subscript (`<sup>`, `<sub>`)** : Formatting text for scientific or mathematical notation.
* **Code Snippets (`<code>`, `<pre>`)** : Displaying small code fragments or preformatted text.

## Key Concepts & Takeaways

* **Tables for tabular data ONLY:** Use tables to display data that truly belongs in a grid (like spreadsheets), not for layout.
* **Table structure:** `<table>` contains `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and optionally `<tfoot>`.
* **`<tr>` (Table Row):** Defines a row in the table.
* **`<th>` (Table Header):** A header cell, typically bold and centered, found in `<thead>`.
* **`<td>` (Table Data):** A standard data cell, found in `<tbody>`.
* **`<sup>` for superscript:** Raises text slightly above the baseline.
* **`<sub>` for subscript:** Lowers text slightly below the baseline.
* **`<code>` for inline code:** Indicates a short piece of computer code.
* **`<pre>` for preformatted text:** Renders text exactly as written, preserving whitespace and line breaks, often used with `<code>` for multi-line code blocks.

## Daily Exercises & Code Examples

Here are the small, isolated practice files created today:

* **[Table Structure Demo](./exercises/table-structure-demo.html)**: Practice building a well-structured HTML table.
* **[Scientific and Code Elements](./exercises/scientific-code-elements.html)**: Demonstrating `sup`, `sub`, and `code`.

## Portfolio Project Progress

Today, I added a structured project overview to my portfolio and experimented with scientific/code elements.

* Implemented a detailed `<table>` in `projects.html` to list my projects with their technologies, status, and completion dates. Used `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`.
* (Optional) Incorporated `<sup>`, `<sub>`, and `<code>` tags into my `index.html` to practice these specific elements, such as in my skills list or about me section.

## Daily Reflection

Learning about tables clarified their proper use â€“ strictly for data, not layout! Building a functional table was a good challenge. Experimenting with superscript, subscript, and `<code>` tags showed me how HTML can handle even specific text formatting for technical content. My portfolio now has a clear and organized way to display project details.

**Challenges/Questions:**
* Initial confusion on when to use `section` versus `article`, but examples clarified `article` as truly independent content.
* Remembering that `fieldset`/`legend` are for *groups* of controls, not individual ones.

**Next Steps:**
* Perform a final review and polish of the entire portfolio project.
* Prepare for Day 11, which is dedicated to project review and documentation.
