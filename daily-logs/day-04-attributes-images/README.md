# Day 4: More on Attributes & Images 

**Date:** July 16, 2025

## Topics Covered Today

* **HTML Attributes** : Understanding how attributes provide additional information about HTML elements (e.g., `src`, `alt`, `width`, `id`).
* **Self-Closing Tags** : Learning about tags that don't require a closing tag, like `<img>` and `<br>`.
* **HTML Images (`<img>`)** : Embedding images into a webpage, and the importance of `src` and `alt` attributes.
* **Accessibility for Images** : Deep diving into the significance of the `alt` attribute for screen readers and SEO.
* **Image File Formats** : Brief overview of common image formats for the web (JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG).

## Key Concepts & Takeaways

* **Attributes define properties:** They modify the behavior or appearance of an HTML element.
* **`<img>` is a self-closing tag:** It doesn't have a separate closing `</img>`.
* **`src` is mandatory for `<img>`:** It specifies the path to the image file.
* **`alt` is crucial for accessibility:** Provides a text description if the image cannot be displayed, or for screen readers. It's also good for SEO.
* Organize assets: Store images in a dedicated `images/` folder within your project.

## Portfolio Project Progress

Today, I visually enhanced my portfolio by adding images.

* Created an `images/` folder inside `my-portfolio-project/`.
* Added my profile picture (`profile.jpg`) to `index.html` using `<img>` with appropriate `src` and `alt` attributes.
* Placed a placeholder image (`project-placeholder.jpg`) on `projects.html` for a future project thumbnail.

## Daily Reflection

Adding images really brings the portfolio to life! I found it easy to grasp the `<img>` tag and its `src` and `alt` attributes. The importance of the `alt` attribute for accessibility was a significant takeaway â€“ it's not just about what looks good, but also about making the web accessible to everyone. Organizing my images in a dedicated folder also feels like a good practice for larger projects.

**Challenges/Questions:**
* No challenges encourtered, everything run smoothly.

**Next Steps:**
* Continue exploring different image attributes.
* Prepare for Day 5, which introduces graphics and forms.
