# Day 3: Essential Tools & Linking

**Date:** July 11, 2025

**[< Back to Main Course README](../../README.md)**

## Topics Covered Today

* **VS Code & Live Server Usage** (0:56:56): Further familiarization with the development environment, highlighting efficiency tools.
* **Chrome Developer Tools** (1:02:18): Introduction to inspecting HTML elements, debugging, and understanding the rendered page.
* **HTML Links (`<a>`)** (1:06:56): Learning how to create hyperlinks to navigate between pages and external websites.
* **Relative vs. Absolute Paths** (1:11:45): Understanding how to reference files within the same project versus external URLs.
* **HTML Comments (``)** (1:17:10): Using comments to explain code and organize sections within an HTML document.

## Key Concepts & Takeaways

* **Developer Tools are essential:** For inspecting, debugging, and understanding how the browser renders HTML.
* **Links connect the web:** The `<a>` tag is fundamental for navigation.
* **`href` attribute:** Specifies the destination of a link.
* **Relative paths for internal links:** Reference files within your project based on their location relative to the current file (e.g., `projects.html`).
* **Absolute paths for external links:** Use full URLs (e.g., `https://www.google.com`).
* **Comments enhance readability:** Use `` to add notes or temporarily disable code sections without affecting the page display.

## Daily Exercises & Code Examples

Here are the small, isolated practice files created today:

* **[Linking Demo](./exercises/linking-demo.html)**: Examples of internal and external links.
* **[Comments Usage](./exercises/comments-usage.html)**: Demonstrating how to effectively use comments in HTML.

## Portfolio Project Progress

Today, I focused on making my portfolio a multi-page site with functional navigation.

* Created `projects.html` and `contact.html` files inside `my-portfolio-project/`.
* Added a basic navigation section (`<nav>`) with links to `index.html`, `projects.html`, and `contact.html` on all three pages.
* Used HTML comments to clearly delineate different sections within `index.html`.
* **Tested links** using Chrome Dev Tools to ensure correct navigation between pages.

## Daily Reflection

Today's lesson on linking was incredibly practical, as it immediately allowed me to build a multi-page site for my portfolio. Understanding relative paths is key for keeping internal navigation robust. Getting more comfortable with Chrome Dev Tools feels like gaining a superpower for debugging and exploring web pages. I can already see how comments will be invaluable for organizing larger codebases.

**Challenges/Questions:**
* (Optional) _Did you encounter any specific challenges today? Any questions that came up?_

**Next Steps:**
* Practice more with different types of links.
* Prepare for Day 4, focusing on images and attributes.
