# Day 11: Project Work & Final Review

**Date:** July 23, 2025

## Topics Covered Today

* **Comprehensive Project Review**: Re-evaluating all HTML files for correctness, consistency, and adherence to best practices.
* **Debugging & Validation Check**: Ensuring all links work, forms validate, and images/SVGs display correctly.
* **Code Optimization & Readability**: Refining indentation, comments, and overall code cleanliness.
* **Project Documentation**: Creating a `README.md` file specifically for the `project/` folder.

## Key Concepts & Takeaways

* **Quality Assurance:** Regularly reviewing your code is vital for catching errors, ensuring consistency, and improving quality.
* **Browser Developer Tools:** Continual use of Dev Tools is essential for checking element structure, links, and form behavior.
* **Accessibility First:** Always consider how your HTML structure impacts users with disabilities.
* **Documentation is Key:** A clear `README.md` for your project helps others (and your future self!) understand its purpose, structure, and how to use it.
* **Version Control History:** A well-maintained Git history provides a clear chronological record of your development process.

## Daily Exercises & Code Examples

Today was focused on reviewing and documenting the main portfolio project rather than creating new isolated exercises.

## Daily Reflection

What an achievement to complete the HTML phase of my portfolio project! It's rewarding to see all the concepts come together into a functional website. The review process was incredibly helpful for solidifying my understanding and catching minor inconsistencies. Creating the project `README` also taught me the importance of clear documentation. I'm excited for the next steps, especially styling this site with CSS!

**Challenges/Questions:**
* No challenges everything runs smoothly.

**Next Steps:**
* Begin the CSS portion of the course.
* Start planning the visual design for my portfolio.
* Continue the daily Git commit habit!
