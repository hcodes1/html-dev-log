# Day 8: Layout & Structure Fundamentals 

**Date:** July 20, 2025

## Topics Covered Today

* **Block-level Elements** : Understanding elements that take up the full available width and start on a new line (e.g., `p`, `h1`, `div`).
* **Inline Elements** : Understanding elements that only take up as much width as necessary and flow within the current line (e.g., `a`, `span`, `img`).
* **The `<div>` Tag** : The generic block-level container for grouping other elements.
* **The `<span>` Tag** : The generic inline-level container for grouping smaller, inline content.

## Key Concepts & Takeaways

* **Block vs. Inline:** This is fundamental for understanding how elements behave on a webpage and how they will be styled later with CSS.
* **Block elements:** Create "boxes" that stack vertically.
* **Inline elements:** Flow horizontally within the line.
* **`<div>` for structural grouping:** Ideal for creating logical sections in your layout before applying styles. It has no semantic meaning.
* **`<span>` for inline grouping:** Useful for applying styles or targeting specific parts of text without disrupting the flow. It has no semantic meaning.
* These generic containers are powerful placeholders for future styling.

## Daily Exercises & Code Examples

Here are the small, isolated practice files created today:

* **[Block and Inline Demo](./exercises/block-inline-demo.html)**: Visual examples of how block and inline elements render.
* **[Div and Span Usage](./exercises/div-span-usage.html)**: Practice grouping content with `div` and `span`.

## Portfolio Project Progress

Today, I began organizing my portfolio's content into logical structural groupings using `div` and `span`, laying the groundwork for future styling.

* Wrapped distinct sections (e.g., Hero, About Me, Skills) in `index.html` with `<div>` tags.
* Used a `<span>` tag to highlight a specific word within a paragraph in `index.html`.

## Daily Reflection

Today's lesson on `div` and `span` feels very foundational for layout. It's clear that while they don't add visual style on their own, they are crucial for organizing the HTML for future CSS work. Understanding the difference between block and inline elements is a major "aha!" moment for how the browser renders pages. I'm starting to see the invisible structure of webpages more clearly now.

**Challenges/Questions:**
* No challenges everything run smoothly

**Next Steps:**
* Prepare for Day 9, which focuses on Semantic HTML.
