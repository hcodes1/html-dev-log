    <h1>Understanding Block and Inline Elements</h1>

    <h2>Block-Level Elements:</h2>
    <p>Block-level elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available, pushing other elements below them. Think of them as distinct "blocks" of content.</p>

    <p>This is a paragraph (`<p>`). It's a block-level element, so it starts on a new line and occupies its own space.</p>

    <h1>This is a Heading 1 (`<h1>`). It's also a block-level element.</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>List Item 1 (`<li>` inside `<ul>`)</li>
        <li>List Item 2 (`<li>` inside `<ul>`)</li>
        <li>List Item 3 (`<li>` inside `<ul>`)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unordered lists (`<ul>`) and list items (`<li>`) are block-level by default.</p>

    <blockquote>
        This is a blockquote (`<blockquote>`). It's used for quoting larger sections of text and is a block-level element, typically rendered with margins.
    </blockquote>

    <p>The address element (`<address>`) is also a block-level element.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>A horizontal rule (`<hr>`) is a block-level element, creating a thematic break and appearing on its own line.</p>

    <h2>Inline-Level Elements:</h2>
    <p>Inline-level elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as their content requires. They flow within the text content of a block-level element.</p>

    <p>
        This is some normal text.
        <span>This is a span element (`<span>`).</span>
        It's an inline element, so it stays on the same line as the surrounding text.
        <br>
        Here's another example:
        <a href="https://example.com">This is a link (`<a>`).</a>
        It also behaves as an inline element.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's make some text <strong>strong (`<strong>`)</strong> and some text <em>emphasized (`<em>`)</em>.
        Both `<strong>` and `<em>` are inline elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also include an <img src="https://placehold.co/50x50/cccccc/000000?text=IMG" alt="Example Image"> image (`<img>`) inline,
        and it will flow with the text.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's some `<code>` inline code (`<code>`).
        It's often used for short snippets of code within a paragraph.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a <small>small (`<small>`) text</small> example.
        And this is a <b>bold (`<b>`) text</b>.
        Both are inline.
    </p>
