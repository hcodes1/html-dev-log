# Day 5: Graphics & Introduction to Forms

**Date:** July 18, 2025

## Topics Covered Today

* **HTML Graphics (SVG, Canvas)** : A brief introduction to how graphics can be rendered in HTML, focusing on SVG.
* **Introduction to HTML Forms (`<form>`)** : Understanding the purpose of forms for user input and the basic `<form>` tag.
* **Input Types: Text, Email, Password, Number** : Learning to create various single-line input fields using the `type` attribute.

## Key Concepts & Takeaways

* **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):** An XML-based format for drawing vector graphics directly in HTML. They scale without pixelation.
* **Forms enable user interaction:** They collect data from users, which can then be processed (e.g., login, contact, search).
* **`<form>` tag is the container:** All form elements must be placed inside a `<form>` tag.
* **`action` and `method` attributes:** `action` specifies where to send the data, `method` specifies how (GET or POST). (Conceptual for now).
* **`<input>` is versatile:** The `type` attribute changes its behavior (e.g., `type="text"`, `type="email"`, `type="number"`).
* **`name` attribute:** Crucial for all form controls; it identifies the data when submitted.

## Daily Exercises & Code Examples

Here are the small, isolated practice files created today:

* **[SVG Demo](./exercises/svg-demo.html)**: A simple HTML file showcasing an inline SVG.
* **[Basic Form Inputs](./exercises/basic-form-inputs.html)**: Practice with text, email, and number input types.

## Portfolio Project Progress

Today, I began building the interactive part of my portfolio: the contact form.

* Added a simple inline SVG to `index.html` (for practice).
* Created the basic `<form>` structure in `contact.html`.
* Included initial input fields for "Your Name" (text) and "Your Email" (email) within the form.

## Daily Reflection

Diving into forms feels like a major step towards building truly interactive web pages! The initial setup was straightforward, and it's exciting to think about all the ways forms are used online. SVG also seems like a powerful tool for resolution-independent graphics, though I only scratched the surface today.

**Challenges/Questions:**
* No challenges encourtered, everything run smoothly.

**Next Steps:**
* Explore more input types.
* Prepare for Day 6, where I'll dive deeper into form elements.
