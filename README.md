# HTML Dev Log 

This repo serves as my centralized hub for daily notes, code exercises, and the step-by-step development of my personal portfolio website along with leaning HTML.

## Overview

My goal is to build a solid foundation in structuring web content effectively and semantically.

## Repository Structure

* **`daily-logs/`**: Contains subfolders for each day of the course, with a `README.md` acting as a daily log of topics covered, key takeaways, and links to daily exercises.
* **`project/`**: This is my ongoing project, a personal portfolio website, built incrementally using the concepts learned each day.
* **`resources/`**: For any supplementary materials (e.g., slides, PDFs).
